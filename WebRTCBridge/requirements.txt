# Minimal dependencies for stable RTMP bridge
# The current bridge only needs standard Python libraries + FFmpeg

# FFmpeg must be installed and available in PATH
# No additional Python packages required for current stable version

# Future: If color correction is re-added later:
# numpy>=1.24.0
# Pillow>=10.0.0
